It states that we must use abstract (abstract class & Interface) instead of concrete implementation.

High level modules should not depend on low level modules but both should depend on the abstraction.

Example:-
If you are going to shopping mall and there you have purchased something. At the time of payment you give your
credit/debit card for the payment. Now the employee will not bother that which card it is, Whether it is debit card or
credit card. He simply swipe the card and make the payment. So here Payment module is not depend on card Module to check
whether it is debit card or credit card.
