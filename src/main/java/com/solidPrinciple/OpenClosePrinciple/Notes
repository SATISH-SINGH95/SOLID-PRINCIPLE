It states that, according to the new requirements the module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Example:
We create service Interface in which we declare important incomplete methods.
And we also create ServiceImpl class in which we implement Service Interface.

We can not modify NotificationService Interface but we can implement it in other classes.

So, conclusion is we can create interface or abstract class so that it can be implemented in different class according to need.
